    </div>

    <p>
        Tfs is established by Sanket, Vaibhav and Rutwik in 2015 as a supportive group they discusss about daily life and also tease rutwik. Later in second year they have decided to add Mr. Suhel Pakhali but due to internal resistance from rutuk they rejected the proposition but still sanket manages to add suhel.
        Then after some time nitin patil was added on vaibhav's recommondation and then this group stands till date. During mid time prathmesh kusumbe was also added but offcourse
        due to rutuk's policy he is removed. This group is not like it looks many times it is collapsed like USSR.
